            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">Beshique is a smart baby cradle that automatically detects your baby’s wakefulness and gently rocks them back to sleep using adaptive motion and calming sounds.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-2">How does the cradle know when to start rocking?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">Beshique uses built-in computer vision and audio sensors to detect signs of wakefulness — such as eye movement, motion, and sound — and responds with appropriate rocking intensity based on your baby’s state.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-2">Is it safe for newborns?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">Yes. Beshique follows global safety standards and is designed for infants from 0 to 24 months. The rocking motion is gentle and tested extensively to ensure it's soothing and secure.</p>

            <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-2">Can I control or customize the cradle?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">Absolutely. The cradle connects to a mobile app where you can view sleep analytics, adjust motion levels, and change sound settings. It also works automatically out of the box with no setup required.</p>

            <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-2">What if my baby wakes up crying?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">If Beshique detects crying, it will automatically switch to a higher bounce level and play soothing audio. If the baby doesn’t calm within a few minutes, you’ll receive an alert through the app.</p>

            <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-2">Does Beshique work without the app?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">Yes, the cradle works independently with its built-in intelligence. The app is optional for monitoring and customization.</p>

            <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-2">What sounds does Beshique play?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">It comes with a selection of white noise, lullabies, womb-like sounds, and nature audio — all chosen for their proven calming effect on babies.</p>

            <div>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-2">How do I clean the cradle?</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg">The mattress and mesh sides are removable and machine-washable. The body can be wiped down with a damp cloth. We’ve designed everything for quick and easy maintenance.</p>
