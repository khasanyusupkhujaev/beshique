This project is aimed for an automated baby crib. The logic here detects the state of the babe: Sleeping/Awake/Active/Crying. If the baby is not sleeping, the cradle starts to rock the baby trying to put one back to sleep before one starts to cry. For this we have used Raspberry Pi 5 8 GB RAM, Raspberry microphone, Raspberry pi camera module. You also need a proper rocking mechanism in order to connect RPi to it. If you do not want to create your own mechanism, then you can connect RPi to an existing mechanism.
